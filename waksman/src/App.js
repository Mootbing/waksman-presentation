We are a group of students from the Waksman Institute of Microbiology who are interested in learning more about the field of microbiology. We are currently working on a project that involves studying the role of oil exterminators in the environment. Our goal is to raise awareness about the importance of these microorganisms and their potential applications in bioremediation. We hope that you find our website informative and engaging.

            <h1>Discussions</h1>
            <p>A list of possible avenues to explore in future studies and points to kickoff a discussion</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Repeating the Bacillus experiment to confirm its bioremediative properties</li>
              <li>Genetic modification of these bacteria could be explored to enhance their oil-degradation </li>
              <li>Collecting more data over certain time intervals to ensure we get the whole picture of the bioremediative process</li>
              <li>Future studies should investigate the bioremediation capabilities of these bacteria on a wider variety of oils, such as crude oil, used motor oil (as opposed to new), and other types of vegetable oils</li>
              <li>Investigating the interactions between different bacterial strains in mixed cultures could provide insights into synergistic effects that enhance bioremediation</li>
              <li>Laboratory conditions are controlled and may not fully replicate the complexities of natural environments. Perhaps conducting a field study of these bacteria in their natural environments will be benificial to understanding their properties</li>
            </ul>

          <p>We would like to thank Ms. Wleklinski, Dr. Pierce, and Ms. Zanfardino of Rutgers Preparatory School for their continued support of our project and the Waksman Institute of Rutgers University for providing additional resources.</p>
          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            This website is made to display our project on the role of oil exterminators in the environment. We are a group of students from Rutgers Preparatory School who are interested in learning more about the field of microbiology and have chosen this topic for our year round advanced research course taught by and guided by Ms. Wleklinski. Thank you for visiting!
